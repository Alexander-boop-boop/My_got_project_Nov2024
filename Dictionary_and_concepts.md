# Dictionary and concepts

- Git: timeline    
- Github: backup of your timeline

# Conceptual Areas

1. Dev. Area: the path to the topmost folder where you initialized your gift

2. Local Repository: the timeline

3. Staging Area: A space to prepare for a snapshot that will go in my timeline. When making unrelated changes and dont want to gommit them together you can use the staging area to commit one-by-one. 

4. Remote area: back up of the timeline, in this case in GitHub (could also be Gitlab)

# Why use the staging area

It gives a space to organize your changes in time. Because of this you can think logically before making a comit. 

# What if you forget -m in git commit?

it opens a text editor and makes you create a message! too important to escape!
